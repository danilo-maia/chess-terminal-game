# Chess Terminal Game

# About the Project:

I created this project while learning Java through Nelio Alves's Java Course. This project is part of his course and doesn't use any framework - it's just pure Java. It's a challenging project that requires a high level of programming logic, and I learned a lot from it.

# Technologies Used:

- Java

# The game:

## Choosing which piece to move

# How to install it
It's highly recommended to play the game from the terminal, as the terminal clear function does not work from IDEs like IntelliJ. After cloning the project with:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/danilo-maia/chess-terminal-game/new/main?readme=1
```
you need to compile the code and then run it
```bash
cd chess-terminal-game/src
javac application/Program.java
java application/Program.java
```
